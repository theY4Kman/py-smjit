(Incomplete) Cython wrapper code for the SourcePawn VM.
  

*Note: this was my first attempt at loading/executing SourceMod plug-ins from within Python. I eventually ditched the Cython approach after finding it far less trivial than expected. Instead, I ported the SourceMod VM to Python with the [pysmx project](https://github.com/theY4Kman/pysmx).*
